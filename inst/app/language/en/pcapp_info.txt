<p align='justify'><font size='3'><strong>This application is dedicated to the analysis of hydrological time series using principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is a tool for reducing data sets to a small number of relevant components (principal components) and a comparatively large but less relevant number of components. In this way, it is possible to reduce the dimensionality of a data set by focusing on the main components.</strong></font>

In the hydrological context, these main components can be used for various applications, such as the calculation and display of component loadings or the calculation of so-called reference hydrographs using linear regression.

On the right is a schematic example of the factual transformation of six time series (left) into principal components (right). It should be noted that the magnitude of the principal components decreases with increasing rank.

The individual functions of this application are listed in descending order in the side menu. Below you will find brief explanations of the respective sections.</p>
