<p align='justify'>The actual principal component analysis takes place in the <strong>PCA</strong> section and various options for evaluating the principal components and loads are offered. Depending on the availability of metadata, this evaluation includes the following points:

1. Visualization of the <strong>PCA</strong> results as time series
2. Visualization of the <strong>Component loadings</strong>
3. <strong>Combinations of main components</strong>
4. <strong>Pairing of component loadings</strong>
5. Calculation of reference hydrographs using <strong>Linear Regression</strong>
6. <strong>Correlations</strong> between component loadings and metadata

Points 2 and 6 highly depend on the availability of suitable metadata for the representation of spatial distributions and correlations.</p>
