<p align='justify'>In the <strong>Import</strong> section, time series, metadata and vector data can each be loaded into the program in their own sections. To import the time series, it is first necessary to create groups. Using these groups, time series of different types can be loaded in a structured manner and differentiated in the principal component analysis. Predefined groups exist for the metadata and vector data.

Firstly after importing the data, the necessary formatting parameters with which the program knows how to read the tables can be found in the <strong>Table options</strong> box. Secondly, the columns used for further analysis and other necessary parameters must be defined in the <strong>Group options</strong> box. On the time series side, for example, this includes the columns containing the time stamps and the measured values, as well as information on the format of the date and erroneous data.</p>
